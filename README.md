# TradingDreamTeam
This is an implementation of the algorithm written by Erna on the Quantconnect platform. To use with Github and so you don't have to copy back and forth with the online IDE use the following instructions

1. Download the Skylight app from Quantconect
2. Create a new project named `TradingDreamTeam`
3. Sync this with skylight and locate the local copy of the project
4. Copy the folder to another location.
5. Delete the folder `TradingDreamTeam` and clone the Github repository in its place.
6. From the local copy view the hidden files. Accessed on a mac with `cmd + Shift + .`
7. Copy the `.qcproject` file to the new `TradingDreamTream` folder.
8. You can now sync local files to the online IDE and use git as usual to share between users.

### TroubleShooting
Sometimes Skylight sync doesn't work and so one must log out and log back in again.
